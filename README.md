## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   npm install

3. **Start the development server**
   ng serve

4. **Open in your browser**  
   Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://0.0.0.0:4200) on your computer.  
   üí° You can also access the app from other devices on the same local network using your machine's local IP address, e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:4200`.

The app will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source files.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
